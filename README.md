# api-for-world-wise

This code has been deployed in Vercel https://api-for-world-wise.vercel.app/cities and in Render https://api-for-world-wise.onrender.com/cities

The only difference is Vercel does not support post and delete for the data while Render does, which suits my project World-Wise's need for data modification.

Please note that both links could be expired due to inactivity. And I am more than happy to bring them back to live if anyone is interested.
